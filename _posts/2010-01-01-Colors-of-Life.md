I remember a short story written by a notable bengali writer Bonoful (Balaichand Mukhopadhyay) named 'Dadur Uttor' (My grandfather's response). If I may summarize the main context of the tale for those who dont know the story. One day a small kid got curious and enthralled after seeing a colorful sunset at the bank of a river. He retuned home thinking 'why there are so many colors in the sky?. Later that evening, his grandfather overheard a conversation between the kid and his private tutor about the same topic and later decided to explain it in a different way. The grandfather explained, the sun being very generous, spread innumerable colors every morning in the sky and then they gradually spread across everywhere including in the mother's love, in the caring of a father, in the smile of a sibling, etc. The sun collect them back during sunset. The kid liked the answer a lot better than what he got from his private tutor earlier. The story ends with the fact that the kid is now grown-up and understood the real technical reason for those colors in the sky, but he still believes in the explanation that his grandfather told him once.

The reason I still remember the story even after 15 years, is because I also do believe in that explanation proffered by the old guy.
