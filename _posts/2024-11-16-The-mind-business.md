In progress --- 
For the last few weeks, I am trying to practice meditation. After reading quite a few reviews and watching several videos, I understood a couple of things - 

1. It's quite difficult to know from internet blogs the exact state of mind when true meditation is achieved. 
2. When the above is true, then it's rather difficult to find an optimum process that leads to the ultimate goal. As every human body is different, therefore one process fits all may not work. 

As I don't consider myself an expert, I can only write about my perception and experience that I gathered so far. 
#### What is meditation? 
The textbook definition of Meditation says it's a process of looking inward. The primary goal is to make the mind void of any thoughts and be able to maintain that state indefinitely or as needed. It's rather difficult to realize the textbook definition for a beginner. Instead, it may be explained through some analogy like a bowl of water. The surface of the water remains calm until it gets perturbed by wind or external forces like stones or pebbles etc. We can compare the surface of the water to the mind and external forces as thoughts that occur within. If we pay attention, the thoughts that occupy our minds are normally related to our past or future. So the first idea for meditation would be to clean up all thoughts so that the mind would become like the undisturbed surface of the water in the bowl. I mentioned the word 'first' as the first step of the overall spiritual journey that one can pursue. It says going beyond the first step isn't easy. Most of the well-known Hindu and Buddhist spiritual leaders had their gurus to guide them through their spiritual journey. Without that it would be like traveling somewhere unknown or new without having any GPS or maps.

#### How to start?

As I haven't reached the destination yet, I can't write something like "how to do?" instead I am sharing my own experience. As stated almost everywhere, there are some recommended [postures](https://www.thewayofmeditation.com.au/meditation-posture) for doing meditation. I use [Vajraasana](https://www.healthifyme.com/blog/vajrasana-pose/) as I felt it to be most suited for me. And, that's it. Just to be seated with patience and waiting, hoping for nothing. The first couple of weeks were the most difficult for me. This is where I started to observe my mind probably for the first time in my life.

#### My experience

I can summarize my first few weeks of experience with driving on an icy road without good snow tires. Another example could be to try to catch a slippery fish directly from the water. The mind kind of works like the car on the icy road or like fish which easily finds a way out of our grasp even when we felt we have it. It's astonishing to see how the mind travels through various topics from past and future (not sure about the present) and sometimes made me ponder over them for a few minutes which felt like ages. It's just like water on my palm and I am trying to capture it by making a fist. Surprisingly, when I close my eyes and let my thoughts travel through my mind, I feel exhausted within a few minutes. Gradually, I could sit for 10-20 minutes at a time 2-3 times a day.
