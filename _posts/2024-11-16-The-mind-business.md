For the last few weeks I am trying to practice meditation. After reading a quite a few review and watching several videos, I understood a couple of things - 

1. It's quite difficult to know from internet blogs the exact state of mind when true meditation is achieved. 
2. When the above is true, then it's rather difficult to find a optimum process that leades to the ultimate goal. As every human body is different, therefore one process fit all may not work. 

#### What is meditation? 
Meditation is a process of looking inward. The primary goal is to make the mind void or thoughtlessness and able to maintain that state indefinitely or as needed.
