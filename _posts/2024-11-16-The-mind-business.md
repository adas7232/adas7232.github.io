#### How to start?
As I haven't reached the destination yet, I can't write something like "how to do?" instead I am sharing my own experience. As stated almost everywhere, there are some recommended [postures](https://www.thewayofmeditation.com.au/meditation-posture) for doing meditation. I use [Vajraasana](https://www.healthifyme.com/blog/vajrasana-pose/) as I felt it to be most suited for me. And, that's it. Just to be seated with patience and waiting, hoping for nothing. The first couple of weeks were the most difficult for me. This is where I started to observe my mind probably for the first time in my life.

#### The preliminary experience
I was thinking what would be the best way to summarize my first few weeks of experience. Several metaphors came to mind like driving on an icy road without good snow tires or trying to catch a slippery fish directly from the water. The human mind can be compared with the car or the fish in the environments like icy roads and water respectively. But to me, the most fitting example would be slacklining. Trying to keep the mind in a thoughtless state is very similar to trying slacklining for the first time.

It's astonishing to see how the mind travels through various topics from past and future (not sure about the present) and sometimes made me ponder over them for a few minutes which felt like ages. It's just like water on my palm and I am trying to capture it by making a fist. Surprisingly, when I close my eyes and let my thoughts travel through my mind, I feel exhausted within a few minutes. It's surprising that the uneasiness happens quite fast when we close our eyes. Gradually though, I could sit for 10-20 minutes at a time 2-3 times a day.

As stated in one of the stories of Buddha, at the beginning there is not much of a difference between the mind and muddy water. Gradually, the water gets cleaner while the mud settles in the bottom. Likewise, the mind will prepare itself for acquiring ['samadhi'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samadhi). Although I am far from it, I will keep this blog updated with my journey, so stay tuned.
