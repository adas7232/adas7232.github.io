[comment]: # For the last few weeks, I am trying to practice meditation. After reading quite a few reviews and watching several videos, I understood a couple of things - 

1. It's quite difficult to know from internet blogs the exact state of mind when true meditation is achieved. 
2. When the above is true, then it's rather difficult to find an optimum process that leads to the ultimate goal. As every human body is different, therefore one process fits all may not work. 

As I don't consider myself an expert, I can only write about my perception and experience that I gathered so far. 
#### What is meditation? 
The textbook definition of Meditation says it's a process of looking inward. The primary goal is to make the mind void of any thoughts and be able to maintain that state indefinitely or as needed. It's rather difficult to realize the textbook definition for a beginner. Instead, it may be explained through a tightly-knit string.
