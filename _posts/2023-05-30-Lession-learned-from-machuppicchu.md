**In progress** 

I always wanted to see Machu Picchu and an opportunity arrived in the first month of 2023 when on eof my frined invited me to join a 7 day long trekking to Salakantay and Machu Picchu from Cusco. I had no reason to ignore the invitation. After moving to North Carolina, I have gradually finding hiking attractive not only for my mental hygyne but also it's a good way to remain physically fit. Most of my hiking activities in the last few months are confined around the apallachian trails including, pilot mountains, grand father mounntain, Chimney Rock, Hangning Rock, etc. Pilot mountain and hanging rock state park are the neareast of all from my home and I prepared myself for this trip using various trails on these parks. The maximum elevation of pilot mountain and hanging rock state park is less than 4000 ft. So, I couldn't able to simulate and train myself with the odds that were waiting for me in the Andeez mountians. I opted for Diamox through my primary physician to confront any lack of oxygen related issues. This was my first major multiday hiking adventure and even though I knew I didnt prepared enough, I was excited to see what's waiting for me behind the cloud covered andiz. Providing day to day details on this 8 day trip is not the purpose of this blog. There are a tons of blogs and vlogs are availale on the same topic. During this trip, I found how underprepared I actually was even though I took several days to pack my bags. There are several items were provided my the tour opertors and I choose to opt for them and may be this is here I can start sharing my experience.
Correct gears are one of the most important element for painless trekking and camping. Day hikes of few hours long, won't give us the perspective of trekking 10-12 hours/day for multiple days with rapid changes in elevation. Specifically for this trip, I bought a Gregory day pack with 3 liter integrated water container. Although the reviews are great for this product, I found that Osprey is a better choice due to its versatility and better back support. As I had to carry 5-8 kg in my day pack (as horses and porters can can carry a total of 5 kg/person without sleeping bag), I felt some pressure on my back after few days of continuous hiking. I tried Osprey and felt that my backs are a little more happy. As the weather and temprature changes rapidly along with elevation, it's also convenient to carry multiple jackets in the Osprey backpack. There may be other good backpacks, but this is just my personal experience.

While talking about temperature changes, choosing a right jacket is another obvoius element. For this trekking I carried two differnet jackets (North Face fleece and Columbia down) and I had to frequently chnage  them among them and no jackets throughout the day depending on elevation and whimsical weather of andiz. But none of them provide ventilation and therefore caused significant suffocation of the body. It's quite important to get jackets which allows air ventilation but provide adequate warmth. 

Hiking poles are provided by the tour opertors and I opted for that. That was my one of the biggest mistake. The first poles that were given to me were damaged after a few days. Then luckily I received a second pair (aparently a better one). These cheaply made pole sticks are needed to adjust it's size regularly as they get shorter after few hours of use. Also, as they are not collapsable, it's rather painful to stack them outside of the backpack when they are not needed and bring it back to use as needed. It would be ideal to have them collapsable so that it can be stored in the side pocket. 

It's needless to say, due to significant exposure of UV at high altitude, the whole body should be covered by UPF50+ clothing at all time (pant, long sleeve shirt, neck gaiter, hat).

At the end of the day, during overnight camping, a comfortable sleeping bag, air mattress pad, a good head lamp are must needed apart from other usual items like toiletories. Although sleeping bags are
