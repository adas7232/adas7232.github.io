**In progress** 

I always wanted to see Machu Picchu and an opportunity arrived in the first month of 2023 when one of my friends invited me to join a 7-day long trek to Salakantay and Machu Picchu from Cusco. I had no reason to ignore the invitation.

 After moving to North Carolina, I have gradually found hiking attractive not only for my mental hygiene but also because it's a good way to remain physically fit. Most of my hiking activities in the last few months are confined around the Appalachian trails including, pilot mountains, grand Father Mountain, Chimney Rock, Hanging Rock, etc. Pilot Mountain and hanging rock state park are the nearest of all to my home and I prepared myself for this trip using various trails in these parks. The maximum elevation of the pilot mountain and hanging rock state park is less than 4000 ft. So, I couldn't able to simulate and train myself with the odds that were waiting for me in the Andes mountains. I opted for Diamox through my primary physician to confront any lack of oxygen-related sickness. This was my first major multiday hiking adventure and even though I knew I didn't prepare enough, I was excited to see what was waiting for me behind the cloud-covered Andes. Providing day-to-day details on this 8-day trip is not the purpose of this blog. There are tons of blogs and vlogs available on the same topic. During this trip, I found how underprepared I was even though I took several days to pack my bags. Several items were provided by the tour operator and I choose to opt for them and maybe this is where I can start sharing my experience.

Correct gears are one of the most important elements for painless trekking and camping. Day hikes of a few hours long, won't give us the perspective of trekking 10-12 hours/day for multiple days with rapid elevation changes. For these kind of trips, 22-25 liter day pack is considered ideal (as porters/horses are used to carry upto 7 kgs). One of the useful feature to have for backpack is adequate ventilation (such as external breathable back frame pad). The backpack that I took didn't have that feature and I found my back is always sweaty during the hike. A good example would be [Gregory Citro 24](https://www.gregorypacks.com/packs-bags/hydration-packs/citro-24-h2o-126894XXXX.html?dwvar_126894XXXX_color=Spark%20Orange&cgidmaster=packs-day-packs) or  [Osprey Stratos 24](https://www.osprey.com/us/en/product/stratos-24-STRATOS24S22.html). In addition, cushioned straps would help significantly of applied pressure on the shoulder. Hip and chest straps/belts are also helpful for long haul.

While talking about temperature changes, choosing the right jacket is another obvious element. For this trekking, I carried two different jackets (fleece and down) and I had to frequently change them among them and no jackets throughout the day depending on elevation and whimsical weather of the Andes. But none of them provide ventilation and therefore caused significant suffocation of the body. It's quite important to get jackets that allow air ventilation but provide adequate warmth when needed. Other relevant feature to consider is to be packable and somewhat water-resistant. One example could be [arcteryx](https://www.rei.com/product/185627/arcteryx-atom-sl-insulated-hoodie-mens). Although it's an expensive choice but normally last for long enough to justify the initial hefty investment. It may be little difficult to get all these features in one. So, in general, rain ponchos are carried separately.

Sometimes, hiking poles are provided by the tour operators and I opted for that. That was one of the biggest mistakes. The first poles that were given to me were damaged after a few days. Then luckily I received a second pair (apparently a better one). These cheaply made pole sticks are needed to adjust their size regularly as they get shorter after a few hours of use. Also, as they are not collapsable, it's rather painful to stack them outside of the backpack when they are not needed and bring them back to use as needed. It would be ideal to have them collapsable so that they can be stored in the side pocket ([example](https://www.rei.com/product/202396/black-diamond-distance-z-trekking-poles-pair)).

It's needless to say, due to significant exposure to UV at high altitudes, the whole body should be covered by UPF50+ clothing at all times (pants, long sleeve shirt, neck gaiter, hat) in addition to applying sun-blocker as needed.

At the end of the day, during overnight camping, a comfortable sleeping bag, air mattress pad, and a good headlamp are must be needed apart from other usual items like toiletries. Although sleeping bags were provided by the tour operators, I used mine. But I used the air mattress provided by them. Again, it was ok but next time I would take something like [this](https://www.amazon.com/Tame-Lands-Camping-Sleeping-Pad/dp/B08KFQN25X/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=packable+sleeping+pad&qid=1685553029&sr=8-5) with me.
