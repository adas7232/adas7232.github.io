Pursuing an MBA differs somewhat from an Executive MBA (EMBA), leading to variations in school rankings for each. Not all institutions provide a dedicated resident Executive MBA program suitable for working professionals. Some schools like Wharton (Penn) and Sloan (MIT) require employer time sponsorship letters during the application process. Additionally, the test score prerequisites vary between MBA and EMBA programs. To streamline this information, I've compiled a table showcasing the top EMBA schools in the US, along with my personal ranking based on research from various sources, including online resources and discussions with admissions committee members.
