I remember a beautiful short story by the Bengali writer Bonoful (Balaichand Mukhopadhyay) called *Dadur Uttor* (*My Grandfather’s Answer*). Here’s a quick summary for those who haven’t read it:

One evening, a little boy stood by the river Ganga, mesmerized by the colorful sunset. Filled with curiosity, he returned home wondering, *"Why is the sky so full of colors?"* That night, his grandfather overheard the boy asking his tutor the same question. Later, the grandfather offered his own explanation:  

“The sun is incredibly generous and shares its colors with the world. Every morning and evening, we see a glimpse of that generosity in the sky. These colors then spread all around us – in a mother’s love, a father’s face, a sibling’s smile, the flowers, the fruits, the birds, and so much more.”

The boy loved this answer far more than the scientific explanation he’d heard earlier. Years later, as an adult, he understood the science behind sunsets. Yet, he still cherished his grandfather’s words.

Even after 25 years, this story stays with me. Maybe it’s because it left a lasting impression on me when I first read it. Like that boy, I’m still captivated by sunsets. As someone who rarely catches a sunrise, sunsets are my special moments. Whenever I can, I snap photos of these magical sights with my phone.

Looking back at my collection of sunset photos, I realize no two sunsets are the same, just like people. This randomness is what makes them so special. It reminds me that life would be dull without variety. Sunsets always lift my spirits, even on tough days. I find these colors in my wife’s smile, my daughter’s bright eyes, and my son’s playful face. And sometimes, I look for those colors in myself – they remind me to appreciate the good days and be generous on the bad ones. They inspire me to help those who aren’t as fortunate.
