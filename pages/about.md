# About
It's been a quite journey for a small town boy who dreamed about the ordinary life. Well, I have probably said that wrong. No life is ordinary unless we see it that way. So, for me the ordinary life represents the usual day-to-day life around me in Kharagpur. May be I tried to beat the struggle that I was doing to keep myself relevant in various rat races. Definitely I was naive. Later I realized that struggle is omnipresent. Sometimes, I get to choose which one to deal with and sometimes I don't. I also understood that choosing to confront the appropriate struggles helps me to achieve what I dreamed for. Some people calls them being constantly outside of the comfort zone. It's ironical that because if this struggles, life feels pleasant, rewarding, blessed on some days and tiring, painful, challenging  on other days. I guess, we can't have our highs without the lows. The path is still quite long although destination is visible somewhat, and, instead of walking I am trying to trot, taking one day at a time, carefully choosing my struggles (at least I am trying to). And, I will be there....

You might wondering the paragraph above is not an ideal 'about me' example. You are probably right. Unfortunately I don't have much to say about myself except I have a great family around me. I am thankful to them that they tolerate me who is quite boring in current social media standards, who feels parties like birthday celebrations are waste of time, who likes to work even on weekends if not hiking somewhere, likes to eat at home than outside, likes to stay far from the busy, noisy, bright and apparently happy city streets. I guess, if you really would like to know about me, my blog posts would be a better place to start. But, don't hesitate to drop me a line if you have any queries or would like to give feedback.
