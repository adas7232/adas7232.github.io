# About
It's been quite a journey for a small town boy who dreamed about beyond ordinary life. Well, I have probably said that wrong. No life is ordinary unless we see it that way. So, for me, ordinary life represents the usual day-to-day life around me in Kharagpur. Maybe I was exhausted from the struggle that I was doing to keep myself relevant in various rat races. I was naive. Later I realized that struggle is omnipresent. Sometimes, I get to choose which one to deal with, and sometimes I don't. I also understood that choosing to confront the appropriate struggles helps me to achieve what I dream for. Some people call them being constantly outside of their comfort zone. It's ironic because of these struggles, life feels pleasant, rewarding, and blessed on some days and tiring, painful, and challenging on other days. I guess we can't have our highs without the lows. The path is still quite long although the destination is visible somewhat, and, instead of walking, I am trying to trot, taking one day at a time, carefully choosing my struggles (at least I am trying to). And, I am sure I will be there at some point in time....

You might be wondering if the paragraph above is not an ideal 'about me' example and you are probably right. Unfortunately, I don't have much to say about myself except I have a great family around me. I am thankful to them that they tolerate me for who I am which is quite boring by current social media standards, who feels most parties are a waste of time, who likes to debate politics among like-minded friends for hours, who likes to cook and eat at home rather outside and, likes to stay far from the busy, noisy, bright and happy city streets. I guess, if you really would like to know about me, my blog posts would be a better place to start. But, please don't hesitate to drop me a line if you have any queries or would like to give feedback.
